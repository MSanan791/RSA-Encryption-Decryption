Encryption Decryption with GUI (C# File + Cpp File)

The entire project revolves around creating a mechanism for encryption and decryption of data in 
a secure way that users won’t have to worry about sharing sensitive information with trustworthy personnel via computerised medium. The system will contain a key generator which will generate an encryption key and decryption key and place them in encryption and decryption directories. If supposedly a message isn’t encrypted it will first be encrypted via the newly generated encryption key and placed in the encryption directory. The Decryption will take place by taking the encrypted message from the directory and use the algorithm for decryption with the private key.
