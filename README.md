# RSA Encryption and Decryption Program

## Overview

This project implements RSA encryption and decryption algorithms in C++ for secure data transmission. The program facilitates the generation of RSA key pairs (public and private keys) and allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages securely using these keys.

## Features

- **Secure RSA Encryption**: Developed RSA encryption and decryption algorithms to protect data during transmission.
- **Key Pair Generation**: Automatically generates public and private keys for secure encryption and decryption.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages are encrypted using the recipient's public key and can only be decrypted using the recipient's private key.

## Program Structure

The program consists of the following key components:

1. **RSA Key Generation**: 
   - Generation of a pair of RSA keys (public and private) for each user.
   
2. **RSA Encryption**:
   - Encryption of messages using the recipient's public key.
   
3. **RSA Decryption**:
   - Decryption of received messages using the recipient's private key.

### How RSA Works

- **Key Generation**: RSA uses two large prime numbers to generate public and private keys.
- **Encryption**: A message is encrypted using the public key, which can be shared openly.
- **Decryption**: The encrypted message can only be decrypted by the private key, ensuring data confidentiality.

## Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC)
- Basic knowledge of cryptography, particularly RSA

## How It Works

1. **Key Generation**:
   - Two large prime numbers are chosen to generate the RSA public and private keys.
   
2. **Message Encryption**:
   - The message to be encrypted is first converted into a numeric form.
   - The encryption formula is:  
     \[
     \text{ciphertext} = (\text{message}^{\text{public key}}) \mod n
     \]
     where \( n \) is part of the key pair.

3. **Message Decryption**:
   - The recipient uses their private key to decrypt the received message:
     \[
     \text{message} = (\text{ciphertext}^{\text{private key}}) \mod n
     \]

### Example Flow

1. Generate RSA keys:
   - Public key (used for encryption)
   - Private key (used for decryption)

2. Encrypt a message:
   - Convert the message into a numeric representation.
   - Encrypt using the recipient's public key.

3. Decrypt the message:
   - Use the private key to decrypt the numeric data back into readable text.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Program**:
   
   Compile the program using your C++ compiler. Example using g++:
   ```bash
   g++ rsa.cpp -o rsa
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   Execute the program to generate RSA keys and perform encryption/decryption.
   ```bash
   ./rsa
   ```

3. **Encryption and Decryption Process**:
   - The program will generate a public and private key pair.
   - You can encrypt a message using the public key and then decrypt it using the private key.

## File Descriptions

- `rsa.cpp`: The main C++ file containing RSA key generation, encryption, and decryption functions.
- `rsa.h`: Header file defining the RSA algorithms and helper functions for encryption and decryption.

## Notes

- RSA keys should be large enough (e.g., 2048-bit or more) to ensure security.
- The program assumes basic message encoding (e.g., converting strings to integers), which could be enhanced for more complex use cases.
- The project does not include networking; it's focused solely on RSA encryption and decryption functionality.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement optimized prime number generation for larger key sizes.
- Add support for advanced padding schemes to further enhance security.

## Project Overview: RSA-Based Secure Data Handling with GUI (C# and C++)

This project aims to develop a secure file encryption and decryption system using the RSA algorithm, complemented by a user-friendly graphical interface. The system is designed to handle sensitive information with high security by employing RSA for cryptographic operations.

### Key Features:

1. **RSA Encryption and Decryption**:
   - Utilize the RSA algorithm, a widely-recognized asymmetric encryption technique, to ensure robust data security.
   - RSA will be employed for encrypting files with a public key and decrypting files with a corresponding private key, providing a secure method for data protection.

2. **Key Management**:
   - Automatically generate RSA key pairs (public and private keys) essential for the encryption and decryption processes.
   - Store these RSA keys securely in designated directories to ensure their availability and protection.

3. **File Handling**:
   - **Encryption**: When a file is selected for encryption, the system uses the RSA public key to encrypt the file. The encrypted file is then saved in a secure encryption directory.
   - **Decryption**: To decrypt, the system retrieves the encrypted file from the directory and uses the RSA private key to restore the original content.

4. **User Interface**:
   - Develop an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) in C# to facilitate seamless user interaction with the encryption and decryption functions.
   - The interface will allow users to easily select files, manage RSA keys, and perform encryption or decryption operations.

### Technical Implementation:

- **RSA Algorithm**:
  - **Public Key Encryption**: Encrypt files using the RSA public key, ensuring that only the holder of the corresponding private key can decrypt the data.
  - **Private Key Decryption**: Decrypt files using the RSA private key, restoring the original data securely.

- **C# Application**: 
  - The primary GUI is developed in C# to provide a user-friendly experience. It handles file selection, key management, and integrates with the RSA cryptographic functions implemented in C++.

- **C++ Library**:
  - Implement the RSA algorithm in a C++ library, which performs the core cryptographic operations. This library is invoked by the C# application to handle the encryption and decryption tasks.

### Workflow:

1. **Key Generation**:
   - Generate RSA key pairs (public and private keys). Store the public key for encryption and the private key for decryption in secure locations.

2. **Encryption Process**:
   - Users select a file to encrypt.
   - The application uses the RSA public key to encrypt the file and saves the encrypted file in a designated directory.

3. **Decryption Process**:
   - Users select an encrypted file for decryption.
   - The application retrieves the encrypted file and decrypts it using the RSA private key, restoring the file to its original form.

This approach leverages the RSA algorithm to provide a high level of security for sensitive data, combining C# for the user interface with C++ for the cryptographic implementation.
